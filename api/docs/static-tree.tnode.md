## TNode class

Implementation for each node of the static tree

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class TNode<Data extends TNodeData = {}> 
```

## Remarks

\#\#\# Constructing TNode

`TNode` is exported in the public api but you should probably avoid constructing `TNode` directly. Instead, use the [buildStaticTree()](./static-tree.buildstatictree.md) helper, as they provide type safety and extension to `TNode` for better developer experience.

\#\#\# Using TNode

By design, `TNode` exposes two proxy method collections through two getters:

- `$`<!-- -->: intended for public usage. You should interact with TNode through this. - `__`<!-- -->: intended for internal usage only. Avoid this.

```typescript
const key = node.$.key();
const path = node.$.path({ depth: 2, separator: '.' });
// ...
```

## Example


```typescript
import { TNode, buildStaticTree } from 'static-tree';

// only do this only if you know exactly what you want
const root = new TNode('root');
const data = { prop: 'value' }
const child = new TNode('child', { parent: root, data });
```
